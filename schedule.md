# Schedule for INSIGHT Physics Immersion Week (June 21 - June 25)

## Monday June 21, 10am-1pm EDT/7am-10am PDT (Instructor: Julie)

#### Relevant Topics to Review Before Class
* Classical Two-Body Problem
* Basic Python programming including the `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` libraries
* The Velocity-Verlet Method

#### Class Schedule (10am-12pm EDT, 12pm EDT is set aside as an extra office hour)
* 10:00-10:30: Introduction to the course and Q&A on the pre-course assignments (additional questions can be asked during the office hour immediately after class)
* 10:30-11:00: Lecture on the classical two-body problem and how to translate a two-body problem to Python code
* 11:00-12:00: Group Learning Activity - In groups of approximately 4 create a Python code that models the Earth-Sun two-body system.  Once correct, try to extend the problem to model two electrons, and finally two nucleons.  A more detailed problem statement can be found [here](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/Day1Activity.md).  (TO-DO: Add document) Questions can be asked about the project during class and after class during the office hour.

#### Learning Goals for Day
* Students should understand the concepts behind the classical two-body problem and be able to write down the equations that are used to solve it.
* Students should demonstrate how the Velocity-Verlet method can be used to computationally model the motion of an object given a force.
* Students should create a Python program that models the earth-sun system and compare it to the expected, analytical answer.
* Students should be able to extend their two-body Python program to model two electrons and two nucleons.

#### Homework Assignment for Tuesday
* Extend one of the two-body problems discussed in class (Earth-Sun, two electrons, or two nucleons) to a three body problem (Earth-Sun-Moon, three electrons, or three nucleons).  Verify through graphs the the programs gives the expected answers.
* Review the lecture notes for Tuesday located [here](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/Day2.ipynb). (TO-DO: Add document)


## Tuesday June 22, 10am-1pm EDT/7am-10am PDT (Instructor: Julie)

#### Relevant Topics to Review Before Class
* Basics statistics such as averages and standard deviations
* Derivatives and integrals in one or more variables
* Complex numbers, complex conjugates, etc.

#### Class Schedule (10am-12pm EDT, 12pm EDT is set aside as an extra office hour)
* 10:00-10:50: Lecture on the the breakdown of classical mechanics and the basics of quantum mechanics including an introduction to wave-particle duality and uncertainty and why we need probabilities in quantum mechanics.
* 10:50-11:00: Break with time for questions
* 11:00-11:50: Lecture on more quantum mechanics basics with an introduction to linear algebra and how quantum mechanics can be formulated as a linear algebra problem.  
* 11:50-12:00: Q&A session and homework help (Monday or Tuesday homework).  Can be extended into the 12pm-1pm office hour time slot.
* A series of short questions will be asked and discussed during the lectures to help you check your understanding of the material.  

#### Learning Goals for Day

#### Homework Assignment for Wednesday
* Complete [this activity](docs/src/JuliesMaterials/Day2HW1.md) (TO-DO: Add document) to review the quantum mechanics and linear algebra concepts learned today.
* Complete [this notebook](doscs/src/JulieMaterials/Day2HW1.ipynb) (TO-DO: Add document) which walks you through how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Python.  Keep this code handy because we will be using it on Wednesday and Thursday.
* Review the lecture notes for Wednesday located [here](link). (TO-DO: Add document (MORTEN))
