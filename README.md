# InsightPhysicsImmersionWeek
This GitHub repository contains all teaching material relevant for the Physics Immersion week of the Insight program.  The aim is to give you an introduction on how to use programming and numerical mathematics (parts of Computational Science) to solve Physics problems, starting with problems from mechanics and the solution of differential equations to eigenvalue problems and quantum mechanics.  

## Assumed knowledge and planned outcomes:
Basic calculus and Classical Mechanics such as harmonic oscillations, two-body problems like the Earth-Sun problem and similar. The classical two-body problem will serve as a basis for solving problems of say interacting electrons (two electrons) or protons and neutrons. These examples will be useful when you start with research projects.  Furthermore, we will use this week to introduce basic algorithms for solving two-body problems as well as central features of programming with Python as language. 

## Pre-reading assignments 
### Physics skills: 
Review of classical mechanics concepts like 
- equations of motion, 
- forces and potentials, 
- two-body problems, harmomic oscillations and 
- conserved quantities.
### Computational Science skills:
- Introduction ot Python, if-else, loops, if-while, arrays etc
- Numerical algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations like Euler's method, Euler-Cromer and Velocity Verlet
