# Insight Physics Immersion (June 21-25, 2021)

This GitHub repository contains all teaching material relevant for the Physics Immersion week of the Insight program.  The aim is to give you an introduction on how to use Python programming and numerical methods (parts of Computational Science) to solve physics problems, starting with problems from classical mechanics and moving to solving quantum mechanics problems by the end of the week.

## Assumed Knowledge 
We assume you have a basic knowledge of calculus and classical mechanics (such as harmonic oscillations, two-body problems like the Earth-Sun problem and similar).  However, a review of these topics will be provided in the pre-reading assignments. Any student who does not feel confident in their knowledge of these topics after reviewing the pre-reading assignments should contact the lectures (Julie Butler: butle222@msu.edu or Morten Hjorth-Jensen: hjensen@msu.edu).

We do not assume you have had any exposure to linear algebra, quantum mechanics, or Python programming.  Any skills from these fields that are needed for this week will be introduced and explained in terms of more basic physics or mathematics.  Python tutorials will be provided as assignments in the pre-reading, but if you have a good grasp of Python, you can skip these assignments.

## Desired Learning Outcomes for the Week
* Students should feel confident in their knowledge of the central features of the Python programming language including basic uses of the libraries NumPy and Matplotlib.
* Studens should be able to solve basic linear algebra problems invovling multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
* Students should be able to apply their knowledge of Python to create program which model physical systems (both classical and quantum) using numerical methods such as Velocity-Verlet or by finding eigenvalues computationally.
* Students should demonstrate a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics including the ability to solve simple quantum mechanical problems such as the infinite well and the harmonic oscillator.
* Students should be able to describe the difference between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics and be able to determine what methodology to use when encountering a new physical system.  Students should also be able to demstrate how the classical two-body problem and the classical harmonic oscillator can be extended to quantum mechanical problems.


## Pre-reading assignments 
### Physics skills: 
Review of classical mechanics concepts like 
- equations of motion, 
- forces and potentials, 
- two-body problems, harmomic oscillations and 
- conserved quantities.

Suggested readings and pre-recorded lectures will be added soon.  We will be working out of the Taylor's classical mechanics textbook (a PDF copy will be provided) but you can use any classical mechanics textbook you feel comfortable with that covers the same material.

### Computational Science skills:
- Introduction ot Python, if-else, loops, if-while, arrays etc
- Numerical algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations like Euler's method, Euler-Cromer and Velocity Verlet
- Extremely useful Python-libraries like Numpy, MatplotLib, Pandas and other.

### Homework assignment:
- Write a program that finds the height as function of time for a falling object with and without viscous drag.
- Write a program that models a ball being kicked
