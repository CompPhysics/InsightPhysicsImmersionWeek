# Insight Physics Immersion (June 21-25, 2021)

This GitHub repository contains all teaching material relevant for the Physics Immersion week of the Insight program (if you are not familiar with GitHub, see [this tutorial](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/Git.md) (TO-DO: Add document).  The aim of this week is to give you an introduction on how to use Python programming and numerical methods (parts of Computational Science) to solve physics problems, starting with problems from classical mechanics and moving to solving quantum mechanics problems by the end of the week.

## Assumed Knowledge
We assume you have a basic knowledge of calculus and classical mechanics (such as harmonic oscillations, two-body problems like the Earth-Sun problem and similar).  However, a review of these topics will be provided in the pre-course assignments. Any student who does not feel confident in their knowledge of these topics after reviewing the pre-course assignments should contact the lectures (Julie Butler: butle222@msu.edu or Morten Hjorth-Jensen: hjensen@msu.edu).

We do not assume you have had any exposure to linear algebra, quantum mechanics, or Python programming.  Any skills from these fields that are needed for this week will be introduced and explained in terms of more basic physics or mathematics.  Python tutorials will be provided as assignments in the pre-reading, but if you have a good grasp of Python, you can skip these assignments.

## Desired Learning Outcomes for the Week
* Students should feel confident in their knowledge of the central features of the Python programming language including basic uses of the libraries `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`.
* Students should be able to solve basic linear algebra problems involving multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
* Students should be able to apply their knowledge of Python to create program which model physical systems (both classical and quantum) using numerical methods such as Velocity-Verlet or by finding eigenvalues computationally.
* Students should demonstrate a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics including the ability to solve simple quantum mechanical problems such as the infinite well and the harmonic oscillator.
* Students should be able to describe the difference between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics and be able to determine what methodology to use when encountering a new physical system.  Students should also be able to demonstrate how the classical two-body problem and the classical harmonic oscillator can be extended to quantum mechanical problems.


## Teaching Staff
We have a collection of three lecturers and four teaching assistants avaliable to helo you this week.  Learn more about our teaching staff [here](people.md).

## Pre-course assignments

These assignments should be completed before the first class meets on June 21st.  These assignments will not be turned into the lecturers for a grade but the material presented for the week will assume you have completed and understood these assignments.  If you have any trouble completing these assignments, please contact the lecturers (Julie Butler: butle222@msu.edu or Morten Hjorth-Jensen: hjensen@msu.edu).

### Physics skills:
Review of classical mechanics concepts like
- Newton's laws and the basic equations of motion
- Forces, potentials, and how they are related
- Two-body problems, especially the Earth-Sun system
- Harmonic Oscillator

Suggested readings and pre-recorded lectures will be added soon.  We will be working out of the Taylor's classical mechanics textbook (a PDF copy will be provided) but you can use any classical mechanics textbook you feel comfortable with that covers the same material.

### Computational Science skills:
We assume that you have no knowledge of the Python programming language coming into this week and have prepared a series of four tutorials covering basic concepts.  If you have already had a course on Python, feel free to skip over any material you know.  If you are new to learning Python there are some additional resources at the end of Notebook 1 that may also be helpful.  These are longer than the notebooks assigned below but give you a more through introduction to the Python programming language.

* [Document 1: Python Programming and Notebooks](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/PreCoursePythonNotebooks.md) (TO-DO: Add document)
* [Notebook 1: Introduction to Scientific Python](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/IntroductionToScientificPython.ipynb)
* [Notebook 2: NumPy for Scientific Python](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/PreCourseNotebook2.ipynb) (TO-DO: Add document)
* [Notebook 3: Matplotlib for Scientific Python](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/MatplotlibForScientificPython.ipynb)
* [Notebook 4: Doing Physics With Python ](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/PreCourseNotebook4.ipynb)(includes a basic review of classical mechanics) (TO-DO: Add document)

### Preparing for Class on Monday (June 21)
* Review [these lecture notes](docs/src/JuliesMaterial/Day1.ipynb) (TO-DO: Add document) and make sure you understand all of the pre-course Python notebooks, but especially Notebook 4.


## Schedule

We will have class from 10am to 12pm Monday, June 21 through Friday, June 25.  There will also be an office hour each day from 12pm to 1pm.  Note that all times are EDT.  The schedule for this week is avaliable [here](schedule.md).  Please note that this schedule is flexible and is subject to change based on how each class period goes.
