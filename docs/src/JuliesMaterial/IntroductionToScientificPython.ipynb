    "**WARNING**: This notebook is not intended to be an all-inclusive introduction to the Python programming language.  Rather it is meant to briefly introduce several programming concepts which are needed to solve physics problems computationally.  There are many great resources for learning Python, several of which are linked at the end of this notebook, for further and more complete investigation.  \n",

    "Physics in the modern day rarely involves solving problems with a pencil and paper. Instead, physicists are increasingly turning to computers to solve problems, so a modern physicist needs to have a good grasp of programming.  Computers are vastly more powerful than the human brain and can perform calculations faster than a physicist could ever do by hand.  This means that problems that are impossible to solve by hand can easily be done with a computer.  Computers are every day opening exciting new avenues of research in physics.  One of the aims of this physics immersion week is to give you a basic understanding of programming so you will feel confident tackling computational problems in the future.  Whether you are interested in studying experimental physics or theoretical physics, programming will be a common task for you moving forward in your physics career.\n",

    "One of the most popular programming languages in physics currently is a language called Python. A programming language is a set of instructions (in words and symbols) that tell a computer what to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's popularity in the physics community comes from a few sources.  Python is often seen as a beginner's language because simpler to learn than other languages you may encounter such as C++ or Fortran.  This does not mean that Python is less powerful than other programming languages, however.  It just does a lot of stuff in the background to keep the user interface simple.  \n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a huge collection library with a variety of uses.  Think of a library as a set of code that someone else wrote that you can use in your own Python code.  Libraries will be covered near the end of this tutorial, and two popular ones will be explored in pre-course notebooks 2 and 3.  Python has libraries that make complex mathematical calculations easier, that enable the creation of publication ready graphs, and has some of the most advanced software in the fields of machine learning and quantum computing.  All these libraries make Python very useful to a physicist.  \n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Python has a very easy way to run its code in an interactive format called a Jupyter notebook (Colabatory is a online version of Jupyter).  You are reading this tutorial in either Colab or Jupyter.  This page is called a notebook and it allows you to run little chunks of Python code interactively and to add in text like this!  You will notice that this notebook is made up of different boxes.  There are two types of boxes on this page (called cells).  There are text boxes (like this one) that just display whatever you want to type in them.  There are also code cells which contain code that can be run on command.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebook**: Click the plus sign in the upper left-hand corner.  This will add a code cell under the current cell (make sure you click on this cell first).  To change it to a text cell, click the dropdown menu in the middle of the toolbar that says 'Code' and change it to 'Markdown'.  Markdown is a language that allows you to write simple formatted text.  You can read more about Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).  All Markdown syntax will work in a Jupyter text cell.\n",
    "* **Colab**: There are two add buttons in the upper left-hand corner.  One for a code cell and the other for a text cell.  These buttons will add a new cell of the selected type under the current cell (click on this cell to add a cell under it).  Colab text cells also work with the Markdown syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebook**: You can run both a text cell and a code cell by selecting the cell (clicking on it) and pressing `Shift+Enter`.\n",
    "* **Colab**: You can also use the `Shift+Enter` method for Colab.  Code cells in Colab notebooks can also be ran using the play button on the left-hand side of the cell.\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXERCISE 1**: Add a code cell below this one.  Type something in using Markdown syntax and run the text cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:**. Every time you come to a code cell, make sure you run it using your preferred method.  Some code cells depend on a previous code cell having been run and if this is not the case then it can cause an error."

    "## If Statements\n",

    "In programming an if statement is what is known as a _conditional statement_.  This means that it will only run if a certain condition is true.  An if statement has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # This code runs if condition is true\n",
    "    Some code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An if statement always starts with the word `if`.  This tells Python that you are setting up an if statement.  Following the `if` is a condition, also known as a _boolean_.  This is a statement that is either true or false.  Examples of booleans include `100 < 1` (which is false) and `2 == 2` (which is true).  When creating a condition or boolean in which two values are compared to see if they are equal, a double equal sign is always used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after the condition of the if statement is a colon.  This tells Python that the condition is finished and it's time to move onto the code.  Note that the code below the if statement is indented.  In Python _whitespace_ (indents) are very important.  They must be there for the code to work properly.

For example, refer back to the while loop example where the variable `i` used in the while condition had to be created before the while loop statement.  In the for loop above `i` is created with an initial value of `0`, the first number in the `range` statement.\n",

A docstring is a comment that is placed right under the function header (the first line starting with `def`) that describes the arguments of the function, the return values of the function, and what the function does.  Docstrings are very useful when you will be sharing your code with others because it describes briefly what your function does so someone does not have to read all the way through your code.

One useful library in Python is called `math`, which allows you to use many useful mathematical functions like square root and the exponential function.  For a full listing of the math library's capabilities, see [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html).  \n",

There are four different ways to import a library, and the next four code cells will show you the different ways.\n",
