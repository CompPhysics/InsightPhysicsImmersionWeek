Hi, my name is Jane! I was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, but I’ve been at Michigan State University for the past seven years as an undergraduate and a graduate student. Halfway through my undergraduate studies in physics and math, I was introduced to programming. Suddenly, I could solve problems that I couldn’t even dream about solving by hand! This made me want to develop this skill even further, so I am now working on a dual PhD in physics and computational math, science, and engineering (CMSE). My research involves using machine learning to solve quantum many-body problems, with a focus on neural networks and variational Monte Carlo.
