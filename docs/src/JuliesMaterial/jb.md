# Using Jupyter Books

Jupyter Books is a software that is used to make nice websites to display text, images, videos, code, and more.  You can read more about Jupyter Books [here](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) if interested.  

We will be using this Jupyter Book to display all of the class materials.  The left hand side of the screen has a panel which displays links to all of the course material in order.  You can navigate through the pages of the book using this panel.  There is also a search bar at the top of this panel.  Each page of this book can be downloaded (using the download button in the upper righthand corner). as either a PDF file for ease of reading offline or as Jupyter notebook.  A Jupyter notebook is an interactive way to run Python codes using a combination of text and code cells.  See the [first pre-course notebook](IntroductionToScientificPython.ipynb) for a further introduction to Jupyter notebooks.  You will need to do this for all of the pages that contain coding exercises.

Below are steps to open Jupyter notebook on both Windowns and Mac.  These assume that you already have the Jupyter notebook installed.  If you need help installing the software please contact one of the instructors by email or on Slack.

## Opening A Jupyter Notebook in Windows
1. Click the Windows icon in the bottom lefthand corner to open the Start menu.
2. Type `Jupyter`.  The first search result should be `Jupyter Notebooks` with an orange circular icon.  Click that.
3. A new tab should open up in your default browser.  This is a Jupyter file explorer.  Navigate through the files until you find the downloaded Jupyter notebook (should be in your Downloads folder).
4. Click on the name of the Jupyter notebook you wish to open.
 
## Opening A Jupyter Notebook on Mac
1. Download the Jupyter notebook from the Jupyter Book webpage.  It should go into your `Downloads` folder.
2. Open a `Finder` window.  Go to `Applications` then `Utilities` then `Terminal`.  This should open a small black window.
3. In the `Terminal` window type `jupyter notebook` and press `Enter`.
4. A new tab should open up in your default browser.  This is a Jupyter file explorer.  Navigate through the files until you find the downloaded Jupyter notebook (should be in your Downloads folder).
5. Click on the name of the Jupyter notebook you wish to open.
